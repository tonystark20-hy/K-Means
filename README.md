# K-means Clustering
This PySpark implementation demonstrates the K-means clustering algorithm, which is used for unsupervised clustering of data points. It utilizes PySpark's distributed computing capabilities to perform scalable and parallelized clustering on large datasets.

## Overview
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition data into clusters. This implementation leverages PySpark to distribute the K-means clustering process across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for efficient processing of large datasets.

## Features
* Distributed K-means Algorithm: Implement the K-means clustering algorithm using PySpark's RDDs or DataFrames for distributed processing.
* Scalable Processing: Utilize PySpark's parallel processing capabilities to handle large-scale datasets.
* Cluster Analysis: Analyze and interpret clusters formed by the algorithm to understand patterns within the data.
* Customization: Configure parameters such as the number of clusters (k), convergence criteria, and initialization method.
## Prerequisites
* Python installed in your environment.
* Apache Spark and PySpark set up on your local machine or a cluster.
